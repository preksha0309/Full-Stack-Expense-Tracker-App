How things work behind the scene :

1.We have a user that wants to sign up or log in they will send a request to our graphql API and then we will use a package called passportjs and we will initialize it in a way that it's going to run the local authentication strategy and that basically means that user is going to send the username and password and depending on that fields we just try to sign up the user or log the user in so any of these are let's say successfully completed .
